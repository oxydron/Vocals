# Vocals

Vocals is a voice recognition software that let you send any keyboard commands to the application of your choice.

## Roadmap
Some technical stuff I want to do
- Regionalize every string
- Comment all code
- Add XML comments on every method/event
- Redesign the main interface (again)

Now some features
- Instead of searching for a command, let the user to write down the command, for example *ctrl+m*, *m+0.3s+Escape+0.3s+Escape*
